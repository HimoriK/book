# Common Programming Concepts

In this chapter we’ll discuss concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in Rust. 

Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments,
and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program.

> #### Keywords
>
> The Rust language has a set of *keywords* that are reserved for use by the
> language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use
> these words as names of variables or functions. You
> can find a list of the keywords in [Appendix A][appendix_a]<!-- ignore -->.
