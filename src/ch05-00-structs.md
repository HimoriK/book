# Using Structs to Structure Related Data

A *struct*, or *structure*, is a custom data type that package
together data into a group. In an object-oriented language, a*struct* is like an
object’s data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples
with structs to build on when structs are a better way to group data.

We'll define and instantiate structs, then define associated functions, especially 
associated functions called *methods*, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. 
Structs and enums (Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types.
