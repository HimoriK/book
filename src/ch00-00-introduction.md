## Rust Utilities

* Cargo, dependency manager and build tool, adds,
  compiles, and manages dependencies. 
* The Rustfmt formatting tool ensures a consistent coding style across
  developers.
* The Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  integration for code completion and inline error messages.

By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be
productive while writing systems-level code.

## Reading Guide

You’ll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and project
chapters. In concept chapters, you’ll learn about an aspect of Rust. In project
chapters, we’ll build small programs together, applying what you’ve learned so
far. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters; the rest are concept chapters.

Chapter 1 for Rust install, a “Hello, world!” program,
and how to use Cargo. Chapter 2 is an intro guessing game program, experienced beginners start here. Chapter 3 covers Rust features
similar to those of other programming languages, and in Chapter 4
discusses Rust’s ownership system. 
Chapter 5 discusses structs and methods, and Chapter 6 covers enums, `match`
expressions, and the `if let` control flow construct.

In Chapter 7, you’ll learn about Rust’s module system and about privacy rules
for organizing your code for the API. Chapter 8 discusses vectors, strings, and hash maps. Chapter 9
explores Rust’s error-handling.

Chapter 10 explores generics, traits, and lifetimes. Chapter 11 teaches testing. In Chapter 12, we’ll build an implementation of `grep'.
Chapter 13 explores closures and iterators: features of Rust that come from
functional programming languages. In Chapter 14, we’ll examine Cargo in more
depth and talk about best practices for sharing your libraries with others.
Chapter 15 discusses smart pointers.

Chapter 16 explores different models for concurrent programming
and how Rust allows to program in multiple threads.
Chapter 17 compares Rust concepts with object-oriented programming
principles.

Appendix A covers Rust’s keywords, Appendix B
covers Rust’s operators and symbols, Appendix C covers derivable traits
provided by the standard library, Appendix D covers some useful development
tools, and Appendix E explains Rust editions.
