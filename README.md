## Changes

The original documentation is filled with fluff, this is a shorthand edit
I created for personal use. 

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same version that
rust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook
[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook --version <version_num>
```

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in
your web browser.

## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
script available in the `ci` directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words,
which is provided in `ci/dictionary.txt`. 

## Contribution

If you'd like to support this rewrite, remove any unnecessary details or rhetoric
included in the documentation. No more than 3 words should explain something rhetorically.
